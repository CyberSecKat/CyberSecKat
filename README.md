 👋 Hi, I’m Kat.
 
👀 I’m interested in Incident Response, Logs, Forensics, Risk Assesment and developing a "golden honeypot" to protect muggles from online threats.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop a legit plan to...save the world.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things cybersec and keeping people and Iot safer online.
📫 How to reach me: cyberseckat at gmail dot com.

⚡ Fun fact: Attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices are expected to double by 2025. Are we ready?
